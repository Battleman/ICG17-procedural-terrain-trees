Marc worked on texturing for terrain and skybox, the noise composition, the spiral chunk generation, basic water reflexions, the freefly camera, work in progress dynamic particles.
Raphael did bezier templated implementation, the BezierCamera, the night day cycle, the frustum culling, bases of shadow mapping and lighting, basic water with reflexion and normal map, glsl includes.
Gr√©goire did the trees, the tiling system, the grass, the deffered lighning, the shadow mapping, the post processing, Camera collisions and most of the optimizations.
